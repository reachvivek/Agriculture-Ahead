# Agriculture-Ahead
## Developed for APPOFF Event conducted under UberTech ’19 by Vivek Kumar Singh.  
## IDEA ABSTRACT :  
India is an agriculture-dominant country. Agriculture sector’s net share in the country’s GDP is 17.32%. Hence, the dissemination of information to the farmers at the time when it is required becomes very important. With the widespread availability of smartphones and Internet, there is a huge potential for supplying essential information via this means.
In this project we provide one such mobile application “Agriculture-Ahead” under development, which can lead to a simplicity of farmer’s life. Agriculture-Ahead is a mobile application built keeping Indian farmers in mind and also a common man who wants to grow vegetables / fruits for his daily need. It keeps a farmer updated with all the information related to crop, pesticides, insecticides, financial sector etc. It provides detailed information about which crop to grow in which season and which crop is suitable for that particular area in which the farmer is living. Government of India is spending millions of money to make ICT helpful for agriculture purpose but the hindrance is the literacy of farmers mobile being a common device now, with this application we aim to make it friendly for farmers with regional language support.

## SCOPE OF IMPACT :  
After surveying and analysing all the needs and demands I’m designing my own Android application “Agriculture-Ahead”. It displays the Crop Production Methods, Treatment Methods, Production Graph Details, Horticulture Methods, and Schemes Provided by Government available to the farmers. So, it combines first 5 aspects of the categorization of applications i.e.; Information, Market and Analysis. In future, the other aspects like various regional languages support will also be added to ensure that application presents a complete solution to all the discussed problems. Through analysis it was known that Android holds a share of 86.18% in smartphone industry of India as of December 2019. The Android offers several customization features, has easy UI (user-interface), affordable, and is readily available. This makes it the choice platform for making an ‘application’ which will reach the rural area as opposed to iOS.

## WHY DO I THINK THIS IS USEFUL?  
Mobile Applications are an amiable option for transmitting information to the people in villages and rural areas. Today farmers are receiving diverse facts or information about faming like seeds, crop selection, crop processes weather, fertilizer, pesticides etc. from various resources which are distributed on many different locations according to its origin, its processors, producers or vendors. It is true that the information is available by means of several applications, videos, images, but the problem lies in the fact that the information is not available at the same platform- a system which covers all the important information about all the domains of agriculture, and available at their location. So, this app assimilates all the relevant important information from all the resources and puts it forward to the end user and in this way it helps the farmers and other people gain knowledge and insights involving or surrounding agriculture domain.
